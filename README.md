# Options Algorithmic Trading Strategy

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on developing and evaluating options trading strategies. The objective of this project is to compare various strategies across different strike prices, implied volatility levels, and times to maturity for options. The strategies involve selecting a subset of options based on specific criteria, employing portfolio optimization techniques, and assessing their performance against standard options trading strategies.

## Project Idea

### Overview

The project revolves around exploring high-frequency options trading strategies and utilizing portfolio optimization techniques to potentially generate positive returns. The primary idea is to select a set of options from a larger investment universe based on specific criteria, such as implied volatility, and then apply various trading strategies to assess their effectiveness.

### Key Objectives

1. Compare options trading strategies across different strike prices, implied volatility levels, and times to maturity.
2. Select a predetermined number of options with the highest implied volatility (or other relevant metrics).
3. Implement trading strategies, including longing one group of options and shorting the other, as well as more advanced portfolio optimization techniques.
4. Evaluate the performance of the developed strategies against standard options trading approaches, such as longing or shorting calls or puts.
