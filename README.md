# Options Algorithmic Trading Strategy

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on developing and evaluating options trading strategies. The objective of this project is to compare various strategies across different strike prices, implied volatility levels, and times to maturity for options. The strategies involve selecting a subset of options based on specific criteria, employing portfolio optimization techniques, and assessing their performance against standard options trading strategies.
